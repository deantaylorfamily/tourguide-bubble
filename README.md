# TourGuide Bubble

A simple offline “tour guide bubble” for groups: the guide speaks into a microphone connected to their phone, and listeners hear the audio on their own phones over a local Wi-Fi network (no cell service required).

## Why this exists
Tours often happen where cellular data is unreliable (catacombs, caves, thick stone buildings, rural sites). This project aims to make group audio simple, low-cost, and dependable.

## Phase 1 (prototype)
- Portable travel router creates a private Wi-Fi network (“the bubble”).
- Tour guide runs the broadcaster app.
- Guests join the Wi-Fi and open the listener app.
- Audio is delivered over the local network.

## Phase 2 (product)
- Polished mobile UI
- One-tap “Join Tour”
- Simple session codes / QR code
- App Store release (low-cost, e.g., $1)

## Status
Early setup: repository initialized and ready for first prototype code.
